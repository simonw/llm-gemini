API access to Google's Gemini models

## Installation

Install this plugin in the same environment as [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/).
```bash
llm install llm-gemini
```
## Usage

Configure the model by setting a key called "gemini" to your [API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey):
```bash
llm keys set gemini
```
```
<paste key here>
```
You can also set the API key by assigning it to the environment variable `LLM_GEMINI_KEY`.

Now run the model using `-m gemini-pro`, for example:

```bash
llm -m gemini-pro "A joke about a pelican and a walrus"
```

> Why did the pelican get mad at the walrus?
>
> Because he called him a hippo-crit.

To chat interactively with the model, run `llm chat`:

```bash
llm chat -m gemini-pro
```

If you have access to the Gemini 1.5 Pro preview you can use `-m gemini-1.5-pro-latest` to work with that model.

### Embeddings

The plugin also adds support for the `text-embedding-004` embedding model.

Run that against a single string like this:
```bash
llm embed -m text-embedding-004 -c 'hello world'
```
This returns a JSON array of 768 numbers.

This command will embed every `README.md` file in child directories of the current directory and store the results in a SQLite database called `embed.db` in a collection called `readmes`:

```bash
llm embed-multi readmes --files . '*/README.md' -d embed.db -m text-embedding-004
```
You can then run similarity searches against that collection like this:
```bash
llm similar readmes -c 'upload csvs to stuff' -d embed.db
```

See the [LLM embeddings documentation](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/cli.html) for further details.

## Development

To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
```bash
cd llm-gemini
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:
```bash
llm install -e '.[test]'
```
To run the tests:
```bash
pytest
```
