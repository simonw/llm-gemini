# Gemini URL Context Feature Research

## Overview
URL Context is an experimental feature in the Gemini API that allows models to retrieve and analyze content from specified URLs as additional context for prompts. This enables the model to extract data, compare information across multiple sources, and answer questions based on webpage content.

## Supported Models
The following models support URL Context:
- `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`
- `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`
- `gemini-2.0-flash`
- `gemini-2.0-flash-live-001`

## Key Capabilities
- Extract specific data points from articles
- Compare information across multiple links
- Synthesize data from multiple sources
- Answer questions based on webpage content
- Analyze content for specific purposes (e.g., investment research, product comparisons)

## Usage Methods
1. **URL Context Only**: Provide specific URLs directly in the prompt
2. **Grounded Search + URL Context**: Enable both tools for broader research capabilities

## API Implementation
The URL Context feature is implemented as a tool in the Gemini API:

```python
# Python SDK example
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=model_id,
    contents="Compare the recipes from URL1 and URL2",
    config=GenerateContentConfig(
        tools=[url_context_tool],
        response_modalities=["TEXT"],
    )
)
```

## Response Format
Responses include `url_context_metadata` that shows:
- Retrieved URLs and their status
- Whether the content was successfully fetched
- Any errors or issues with URL retrieval

## Limitations
- **Maximum URLs**: 20 URLs per request
- **Content Type**: Works best with standard web pages
- **Pricing**: Currently free during experimental phase
- **Quotas**: 
  - 1500 queries/day per project via Gemini API
  - 100 queries/day per user in Google AI Studio

## Best Practices
- Use with specific, direct URLs rather than search queries
- Combine with grounded search for comprehensive research
- Verify URL accessibility before including in prompts
- Consider rate limits when designing applications

## Integration Considerations
- The feature is experimental and may change
- Monitor quota usage to avoid hitting limits
- Handle cases where URLs may be inaccessible
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed URLs
